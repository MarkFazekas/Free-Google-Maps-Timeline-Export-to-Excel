Do you use Google Timeline to track your trips and mileage? If so, you might be tempted to use a Google Timeline Exporter extension to create a mileage log for tax purposes. But beware: these extensions are not reliable or accurate enough to meet the IRS standards for mileage documentation.

Google Timeline Exporter extensions are tools that allow you to download your Google Timeline history as a file, such as KML or CSV. They can be useful for creating travel maps or personal records, but they are not designed for creating IRS proof mileage logs. Here are some of the limitations and risks of using these extensions:

They do not capture all the details that the IRS requires, such as the purpose of each trip, the starting and ending locations, the odometer readings, and the business percentage of each trip.
They do not account for gaps, errors, or missing data in your Google Timeline history, which can result from poor GPS signal, battery drain, or manual edits.
They do not allow you to categorize your trips by business, personal, or commuting, or to apply the standard mileage rate or the actual expense method.
They do not help you to correct or reconstruct your mileage log if you are audited by the IRS, which can result in penalties, interest, or disallowed deductions.
