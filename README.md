# Free Google Maps Timeline Export to Excel

## Disclaimer

**Attention:**
Your trips exported from Google Maps Timeline with any tool are not sufficient as an **IRS-Proof** mileage log - points out our *Platinum sponsor*, [MileageWise](https://www.mileagewise.com) in their [blog post](https://www.mileagewise.com/free-mileage-logs-with-google-timeline/?utm_source=googlechrome&utm_medium=timelineviewerextension&utm_campaign=extension).
MileageWise, on the other hand, is able to convert these exported trips into an **IRS-Proof** mileage log.
